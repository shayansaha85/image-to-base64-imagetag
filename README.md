# image-to-base64-imagetag
This python script can help to convert any image in an independent image tag to be used in html with the help of base64 encoding.


Generally when we add any photo in our html, we add the image name or image link from another website in the image tag. Means we are depending on some other sources for the existence of that image. To mitigate this issue I created this script. With You have to add your all images in a folder, and give the folder path in my python script. It will generate independent image tags, which are ready to use in your html files, without any local or remote reference.
