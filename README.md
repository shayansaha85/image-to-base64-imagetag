# image-to-base64-imagetag
This python script can help to convert any image in an independent image tag to be used in html with the help of base64 encoding.


Generally when we add any photo in our html, we add the image name or image link from another website in the image tag like this
<br>
<code>"<img src="example.jpg">"</code>
